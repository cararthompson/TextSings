Visualising Male and Female Representation in Text
================
Cara Thompson

## Welcome!

This is the Github Repo for my [Text Sings Shiny
app](https://cararthompson.shinyapps.io/VisualisingMFRepresentation/).
It’s here to make the code available to others, as well as to help keep
track of issues, bug reports and feature requests.

## What does the app do?

This app is based on the following writing advice by Gary Provost.

The app takes a text input and highlights the sentences according to
their length. The aim is to help those writing texts quickly see whether
or not the length of their sentences varies in a way that makes the text
“sing”. Any edits users make to their text are reflected in the output,
providing users with immediate feedback.

## Can we see a demo?

<!-- Sure! -->
